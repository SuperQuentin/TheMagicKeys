**** TODO ****
- Generate all notes from A0 to A7 instead of C1 to C8.
- Add mode demo that reads the entire midi file.
- Add new sounds banks: Mellotron....
- Add mode with generated sounds.
- Study volume computation. Nicolas thinks the linear rule is not the best.
- Grand piano: Propose mode with velociy 8 instead of 16.
- Make release time depending on the note.
