In directory audio_samples, we have:

- The directory freesound_25405__tedagame__88-piano-keys-long-reverb contains the wav files 
for the 88 keys of a piano in archive wav_sorted_nico.zip.
The original files are OGG files coming from the web site https://freesound.org. 
OGG files have been converted in WAV and then ordered thanks to a script and to Nicolas.

- The directory sampler_box_GrandPiano contains the wav files for the 88 keys of a piano 
in archive velocity_16_all_notes_mono_remove_end_renamed_for_sd_card.zip.
Original WAV files comes from the site samplerbox.org. 
The original WAV files are in stereo, with different velocity (from v1 to v16) and only one note 
over 3 are recorded (only notes C, D#, F# and A). I choose velocity 16 and built the missing notes 
with an audacity macro. Then I renamed the notes with a python script. Then I convert the wav in mono and I cut the end with an audacity macro.
Doing so, the total size is around 50 MB and can fit in 64 MB RAM memory of the daisyseed.
