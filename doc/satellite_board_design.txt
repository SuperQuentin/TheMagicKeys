U1 is the voltage between key 1 pin (COM pin) and ground.
U2 is the voltage between key 2 pin and ground (NC pin).

D1 and D2 are the corresponding digital signals

Possible values:
U1   U2   D1 D2   Comment
5V   5V   1  1    UP Position. Default Position. 
0V   5V   1  0    Position between UP and DOWN.
0.7V 0.7V 0  0    DOWN position.

**** Key groups, number of MUX and number of GPIO ****
Considering the key layout, we decide to group the keys by 6 (2 green flat cables). We call this a key group.
For 84 keys , we have 14 key groups. One satellite board will manage 1 or 2 key groups (2 or 4 green flat cables).
For each key, 2 inputs must be read. Thus, for each key group 2 x 8 channels multiplexers will be needed.
Note that each board can read 2 additional keys. This will be used to connect the 2 pedals and the additional key (we have 85 keys).

On the Arduino, 23 GPIO are available. 
We will use RX and TX for communication -> 21 GPIO are left.

** Solution 1: Minimize the reading time. **
3 outputs are used to address keys one by one in a key group.
2 outputs are used to address key group1..7 or key group8..14
14 inputs are used to read the state of key group1..7 or key group8..14 (7 keys read at once).
Total: 19 GPIO

**** Jumpers ****

** J1 and J2 **
J1 ON -> Board belong to key group1..7 
J2 ON -> Board belong to key group8..14

Possible configurations:
J1   J2		Comment
ON   OFF	key group1..7 
OFF  ON		key group8..14

** J3, J4, J5 and J6 ** 
J3 ON -> MUX 1 I6 connected to additional key voltage U2 
J4 ON -> MUX 1 I6 connected to ground.
J5 ON -> MUX 2 I6 connected to additional key voltage U1 
J6 ON -> MUX 2 I6 connected to ground.

Possible configurations:
J3  J4  J5  J6		Comment
ON  OFF ON	OFF 	Additional key managed
OFF ON	OFF ON		Additional key not managed
